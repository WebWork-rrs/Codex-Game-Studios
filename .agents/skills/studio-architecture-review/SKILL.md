## Codex execution adapter

Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` before this workflow. Its Codex mappings and
the user's existing authorization govern this workflow and all referenced
upstream documents. Work from the repository root.

- `$studio-NAME` invokes a repository skill; arguments are the text supplied
  with the invocation. Do not expect Claude slash commands or `$ARGUMENTS`
  substitution. Read another skill's `SKILL.md` when chaining workflows.
- Run each **Execute before proceeding** shell block explicitly; Codex does
  not run Claude's inline shell preprocessing. Use the real configuration
  output. Report command failures rather than silently assuming defaults.
- `AskUserQuestion` means ask with an available Codex question tool or plain
  text, and wait when the answer is required. Previously authorized routine
  edits need no repeated per-file approval. Preserve unresolved game-design
  choices and the configured automation mode.
- Claude `Agent`/`Task`, `subagent_type`, and named roles mean Codex subagents.
  Use `.codex/agents/<role>.toml` when custom role selection is supported;
  otherwise pass its `developer_instructions` to the available spawn tool.
  Use only actual available tools, inherit the user's model, respect the
  concurrency limit, and collect results. If delegation is unavailable,
  perform the roles sequentially and label that limitation.
- `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash`/`WebSearch`/`WebFetch` are capability
  labels: map them to available file, patch, shell, and browsing tools.
  `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, and task lists map to available collaboration
  tools and a written task ledger; do not invent tools.
- Shared `.claude/docs`, `.claude/scripts`, `.claude/hooks`, and templates are
  intentional runtime dependencies. Relative `references/` and `scripts/`
  paths resolve against this skill's folder. Original references may still
  show `/NAME`: interpret known studio workflows as `$studio-NAME`.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a legacy engine/configuration mirror. Codex reads engine
  settings from `project.yaml` and explicitly reads the matching version
  reference. `@file` imports, Claude settings, status lines, and permissions
  do not configure Codex. Preserve `AGENTS.md` during engine setup.
- For design/architecture/registry/review inputs, apply
  `.claude/docs/bounded-document-reading.md`: inventory ranges and read with
  `.claude/scripts/read-markdown.py` using returned line/column cursors.
  Upstream "read in full" means complete coverage through bounded chunks,
  never an unbounded tool response. Record gaps as NOT ASSESSED.
- Edit upstream skill/role sources under `.claude/`, then run
  `python3 tools/codex/studio.py sync` to regenerate Codex copies. Do not edit
  generated files directly. Apply the same rule to framework self-tests.


**Execute before proceeding** (from the repository root):

```bash
bash ".claude/hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config --keys automation,workflow
```
# Architecture Review

The architecture review validates that the complete body of architectural decisions
covers all game design requirements, is internally consistent, and correctly targets
the project's pinned engine version. It is the quality gate between Technical Setup
and Pre-Production.

**Argument modes:**
- **No argument / `full`**: Full review — all phases
- **`coverage`**: Traceability only — which GDD requirements have no ADR
- **`consistency`**: Cross-ADR conflict detection only
- **`engine`**: Engine compatibility audit only
- **`single-gdd [path]`**: Review architecture coverage for one specific GDD
- **`rtm`**: Requirements Traceability Matrix — extends the standard matrix
  to include story file paths and test file paths; outputs
  `docs/architecture/requirements-traceability.md` with the full
  GDD requirement → ADR → Story → Test chain. Use in Production phase when
  stories and tests exist.

---

Every `AskUserQuestion` call follows `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative asks always · guided major-only · autonomous logs and proceeds;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**`workflow`** (see `.claude/docs/workflow-modes.md`):
- `full` — full traceability matrix across all GDDs and all ADRs.
- `standard` — reduced scope: architecture doc + critical ADRs only.
- `minimal` — not applicable (no architecture doc required).

## Phase 1: Load Everything

**Read `references/1-load.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 2: Extract Technical Requirements from Every GDD

**Read `references/2-extract-requirements.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 3: Build the Traceability Matrix

**Read `references/3-traceability.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 4: Cross-ADR Conflict Detection

**Read `references/4-conflicts.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 5: Engine Compatibility Cross-Check

**Read `references/5-engine.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 6: Architecture Document Coverage

**Read `references/6-document-coverage.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 7: Output the Review Report

**Read `references/7-report.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 8: Write and Update Traceability Index

**Read `references/8-write.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 9: Handoff

**Read `references/9-handoff.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Error Recovery Protocol

**First, verify the artifact.** If the return contract named a path, check the
path exists before treating the phase as done — **a named artifact that is not
on disk is a failed phase, however fluent the response reads.** An agent can
burn a full phase and return a plausible preamble having written nothing, which
is neither BLOCKED nor an error nor "fails to complete", so the trigger below
never fires. Resume it naming the unmet contract; the context is
usually still there.

If any spawned agent returns BLOCKED, errors, or fails to complete: **surface it
immediately, don't proceed past a dependency it blocks, and always produce a
partial report** (retry scope here = fewer GDDs / single-system). Full procedure:
`.claude/docs/error-recovery-protocol.md`.

---

## Collaborative Protocol

**Applies in `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and
`autonomous` modes, see `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md` — the rules below
describe what collaborative mode requires, not universal behavior.

1. **Read silently** — do not narrate every file read
2. **Show the matrix** — present the full traceability matrix before any write
   approval; let the user see the state
3. **Don't guess** — if a requirement is ambiguous, ask: "Is [X] a technical
   requirement or a design preference?"
4. **Draft before approval** — always show the content that will be written (the
   report, the updated ADR section, the systems-index row) inline in the conversation
   before requesting approval. Never ask to write something the user has not yet seen.
5. **Use `AskUserQuestion` for write approvals** — plain text "May I?" is not
   sufficient. Use the structured tool with labeled options [A]/[B]/[C] so the
   user can choose between "write now", "show full draft first", and "not yet".
   Multi-file changesets must list every file and what changes, then ask once
   with grouped options — not a separate plain-text question per file.
6. **Non-blocking** — the verdict is advisory; the user decides whether to continue
   despite CONCERNS or even FAIL findings
