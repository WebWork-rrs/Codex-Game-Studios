## Codex execution adapter

Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` before this workflow. Its Codex mappings and
the user's existing authorization govern this workflow and all referenced
upstream documents. Work from the repository root.

- `$studio-NAME` invokes a repository skill; arguments are the text supplied
  with the invocation. Do not expect Claude slash commands or `$ARGUMENTS`
  substitution. Read another skill's `SKILL.md` when chaining workflows.
- Run each **Execute before proceeding** shell block explicitly; Codex does
  not run Claude's inline shell preprocessing. Use the real configuration
  output. Report command failures rather than silently assuming defaults.
- `AskUserQuestion` means ask with an available Codex question tool or plain
  text, and wait when the answer is required. Previously authorized routine
  edits need no repeated per-file approval. Preserve unresolved game-design
  choices and the configured automation mode.
- Claude `Agent`/`Task`, `subagent_type`, and named roles mean Codex subagents.
  Use `.codex/agents/<role>.toml` when custom role selection is supported;
  otherwise pass its `developer_instructions` to the available spawn tool.
  Use only actual available tools, inherit the user's model, respect the
  concurrency limit, and collect results. If delegation is unavailable,
  perform the roles sequentially and label that limitation.
- `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash`/`WebSearch`/`WebFetch` are capability
  labels: map them to available file, patch, shell, and browsing tools.
  `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, and task lists map to available collaboration
  tools and a written task ledger; do not invent tools.
- Shared `.claude/docs`, `.claude/scripts`, `.claude/hooks`, and templates are
  intentional runtime dependencies. Relative `references/` and `scripts/`
  paths resolve against this skill's folder. Original references may still
  show `/NAME`: interpret known studio workflows as `$studio-NAME`.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a legacy engine/configuration mirror. Codex reads engine
  settings from `project.yaml` and explicitly reads the matching version
  reference. `@file` imports, Claude settings, status lines, and permissions
  do not configure Codex. Preserve `AGENTS.md` during engine setup.
- Edit upstream skill/role sources under `.claude/`, then run
  `python3 tools/codex/studio.py sync` to regenerate Codex copies. Do not edit
  generated files directly. Apply the same rule to framework self-tests.


**Execute before proceeding** (from the repository root):

```bash
bash ".claude/hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config --keys review_mode,automation,workflow,docs.density,system_overrides
```
Resolved above — use as-is; `--review` overrides `review_mode`. No block →
defaults in `.claude/docs/config-resolution.md`.

# Design System

When this skill is invoked:

## 1. Parse Arguments & Validate

**Read `references/1-parse-arguments.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## 2. Gather Context (Read Phase)

**Read `references/2-gather-context.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## 3. Create File Skeleton

**Read `references/3-file-skeleton.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## 4. Section-by-Section Design

**Read `references/4-section-design.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## 5. Post-Design Validation

**Read `references/5-post-design.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## 6. Specialist Agent Routing

This skill delegates to specialist agents for domain expertise. The main session
orchestrates the overall flow; agents provide expert content.

**Rows here are finer-grained than the nine `Category` values on purpose** — the
right specialist for combat is not the right specialist for pathfinding, and both
are `Gameplay`. Resolve in two steps: take the system's `Category` from
`systems-index.md`, then pick the row within it that matches what the system
actually does. Every category has at least one row, so nothing falls through.

| `Category` | Rows below to choose from |
|---|---|
| `Gameplay` | Combat/damage/health · AI/pathfinding/behavior · Animation/character movement · Character systems · Camera/input/controls |
| `Core` | Foundation/Infrastructure · Camera/input/controls |
| `Persistence` | Foundation/Infrastructure |
| `Economy` | Economy/loot/crafting |
| `Progression` | Progression/XP/skills |
| `UI` | UI systems · Visual effects (when the system is HUD-adjacent VFX) |
| `Audio` | Audio systems |
| `Narrative` | Dialogue/quests/lore |
| `Meta` | Foundation/Infrastructure (analytics, tutorial plumbing) · UI systems (accessibility options screens) |

If two rows fit, spawn the union of their Primary agents and say why.

| System type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agent(s) |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Foundation/Infrastructure** (event bus, save/load, scene mgmt, service locator) | `systems-designer` | `gameplay-programmer` (feasibility), `engine-programmer` (engine integration) |
| Combat, damage, health | `game-designer` | `systems-designer` (formulas), `ai-programmer` (enemy AI), `art-director` (hit feedback visual direction, VFX intent) |
| Economy, loot, crafting | `economy-designer` | `systems-designer` (curves), `game-designer` (loops) |
| Progression, XP, skills | `game-designer` | `systems-designer` (curves), `economy-designer` (sinks) |
| Dialogue, quests, lore | `game-designer` | `narrative-director` (story), `writer` (content), `art-director` (character visual profiles, cinematic tone) |
| UI systems (HUD, menus) | `game-designer` | `ux-designer` (flows), `ui-programmer` (feasibility), `art-director` (visual style direction), `technical-artist` (render/shader constraints) |
| Audio systems | `game-designer` | `audio-director` (direction), `sound-designer` (specs) |
| AI, pathfinding, behavior | `game-designer` | `ai-programmer` (implementation), `systems-designer` (scoring) |
| Level/world systems | `game-designer` | `level-designer` (spatial), `world-builder` (lore) |
| Camera, input, controls | `game-designer` | `ux-designer` (feel), `gameplay-programmer` (feasibility) |
| Animation, character movement | `game-designer` | `art-director` (animation style, pose language), `technical-artist` (rig/blend constraints), `gameplay-programmer` (feel) |
| Visual effects, particles, shaders | `game-designer` | `art-director` (VFX visual direction), `technical-artist` (performance budget, shader complexity), `systems-designer` (trigger/state integration) |
| Character systems (stats, archetypes) | `game-designer` | `art-director` (character visual archetype), `narrative-director` (character arc alignment), `systems-designer` (stat formulas) |

**When delegating via the `Agent` tool**:
- Provide: system name, game concept summary, dependency GDD excerpts, the specific
  section being worked on, and what question needs expert input
- The agent returns analysis/proposals to the main session
- The main session presents the agent's output to the user via `AskUserQuestion`
- The user decides; the main session writes to file
- Agents do NOT write to files directly — the main session owns all file writes

---

## 7. Recovery & Resume

If the session is interrupted (compaction, crash, new session):

1. Read `production/session-state/active.md` — it records the current system and
   which sections are complete
2. Read `design/gdd/[system-name].md` — sections with real content are done;
   sections with `[To be designed]` still need work
3. Resume from the next incomplete section — no need to re-discuss completed ones

This is why incremental writing matters: every approved section survives any
disruption.

---

## Collaborative Protocol

**In `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and `autonomous`
modes, see the per-mode rules in `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md` — the
"Never" lines below describe what collaborative mode requires, not what
applies universally.

This skill follows the collaborative design principle at every step:

1. **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval** for every section
2. **AskUserQuestion** at every decision point (Explain -> Capture pattern):
   - Phase 2: "Ready to start, or need more context?"
   - Phase 3: "May I create the skeleton?"
   - Phase 4 (each section): Design questions, approach options, draft approval
   - Phase 5: "May I update the entity registry? May I update the systems
     index? What's next?" — **not** "Run design review?": §5c forbids offering
     `$studio-design-review` inline, because the reviewing agent must not inherit this
     session's design history. Phase 5c presents the hand-off; it never asks.
3. **"May I write to [filepath]?"** before the skeleton and before each section write
4. **Incremental writing**: Each section is written to file immediately after approval
5. **Session state updates**: After every section write
6. **Cross-referencing**: Every section checks existing GDDs for conflicts
7. **Specialist routing**: Complex sections get expert agent input, presented to
   the user for decision — never written silently

**Never** auto-generate the full GDD and present it as a fait accompli.
**Never** write a section without user approval.
**Never** contradict an existing approved GDD without flagging the conflict.
**Always** show where decisions come from (dependency GDDs, pillars, user choices).

## Context Window Awareness

This is a long-running skill. After writing each section, check if the status line
shows context at or above 70%. If so, append this notice to the response:

> **Context is approaching the limit (≥70%).** Your progress is saved — all approved
> sections are written to `design/gdd/[system-name].md`. When you're ready to continue,
> open a fresh Claude Code session and run `$studio-design-system [system-name]` — it will
> detect which sections are complete and resume from the next one.

## Recommended Next Steps

- Run `$studio-design-review design/gdd/[system-name].md` in a **fresh session** to validate the completed GDD independently
- Run `$studio-consistency-check` to verify this GDD's values don't conflict with other GDDs
- Run `$studio-map-systems next` to move to the next highest-priority undesigned system
- Run `$studio-gate-check technical-setup` when all MVP GDDs are authored and reviewed
