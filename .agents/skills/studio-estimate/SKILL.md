## Codex execution adapter

Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` before this workflow. Its Codex mappings and
the user's existing authorization govern this workflow and all referenced
upstream documents. Work from the repository root.

- `$studio-NAME` invokes a repository skill; arguments are the text supplied
  with the invocation. Do not expect Claude slash commands or `$ARGUMENTS`
  substitution. Read another skill's `SKILL.md` when chaining workflows.
- Run each **Execute before proceeding** shell block explicitly; Codex does
  not run Claude's inline shell preprocessing. Use the real configuration
  output. Report command failures rather than silently assuming defaults.
- `AskUserQuestion` means ask with an available Codex question tool or plain
  text, and wait when the answer is required. Previously authorized routine
  edits need no repeated per-file approval. Preserve unresolved game-design
  choices and the configured automation mode.
- Claude `Agent`/`Task`, `subagent_type`, and named roles mean Codex subagents.
  Use `.codex/agents/<role>.toml` when custom role selection is supported;
  otherwise pass its `developer_instructions` to the available spawn tool.
  Use only actual available tools, inherit the user's model, respect the
  concurrency limit, and collect results. If delegation is unavailable,
  perform the roles sequentially and label that limitation.
- `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash`/`WebSearch`/`WebFetch` are capability
  labels: map them to available file, patch, shell, and browsing tools.
  `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, and task lists map to available collaboration
  tools and a written task ledger; do not invent tools.
- Shared `.claude/docs`, `.claude/scripts`, `.claude/hooks`, and templates are
  intentional runtime dependencies. Relative `references/` and `scripts/`
  paths resolve against this skill's folder. Original references may still
  show `/NAME`: interpret known studio workflows as `$studio-NAME`.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a legacy engine/configuration mirror. Codex reads engine
  settings from `project.yaml` and explicitly reads the matching version
  reference. `@file` imports, Claude settings, status lines, and permissions
  do not configure Codex. Preserve `AGENTS.md` during engine setup.
- For design/architecture/registry/review inputs, apply
  `.claude/docs/bounded-document-reading.md`: inventory ranges and read with
  `.claude/scripts/read-markdown.py` using returned line/column cursors.
  Upstream "read in full" means complete coverage through bounded chunks,
  never an unbounded tool response. Record gaps as NOT ASSESSED.
- Edit upstream skill/role sources under `.claude/`, then run
  `python3 tools/codex/studio.py sync` to regenerate Codex copies. Do not edit
  generated files directly. Apply the same rule to framework self-tests.


# Estimate

## Phase 1: Understand the Task

Read the task description from the argument. If the description is too vague to estimate meaningfully, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Read CLAUDE.md for project context: tech stack, coding standards, architectural patterns, and any estimation guidelines.

Read relevant design documents from `design/gdd/` if the task relates to a documented feature or system.

---

## Phase 2: Scan Affected Code

Identify files and modules that would need to change:

- Assess complexity (size, dependency count, cyclomatic complexity)
- Identify integration points with other systems
- Check for existing test coverage in the affected areas
- Read past sprint data from `production/sprints/` for similar completed tasks and historical velocity.
  **If there is none**, say so under Notes and Assumptions — "No sprint history found;
  this estimate is not calibrated to the team's velocity" — and treat that as a risk
  in the confidence level, not as a silent padding of the figures.

---

## Phase 3: Analyze Complexity Factors

**Code Complexity:**
- Lines of code in affected files
- Number of dependencies and coupling level
- Whether this touches core/engine code vs leaf/feature code
- Whether existing patterns can be followed or new patterns are needed

**Scope:**
- Number of systems touched
- New code vs modification of existing code
- Amount of new test coverage required
- Data migration or configuration changes needed

**Risk:**
- New technology or unfamiliar libraries
- Unclear or ambiguous requirements
- Dependencies on unfinished work
- Cross-system integration complexity
- Performance sensitivity

## Phase 4: Generate the Estimate

```markdown
## Task Estimate: [Task Name]
Generated: [Date]

### Task Description
[Restate the task clearly in 1-2 sentences]

### Complexity Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Systems affected | [List] | [Core, gameplay, UI, etc.] |
| Files likely modified | [Count] | [Key files listed below] |
| New code vs modification | [Ratio] | |
| Integration points | [Count] | [Which systems interact] |
| Test coverage needed | [Low / Medium / High] | |
| Existing patterns available | [Yes / Partial / No] | |

**Key files likely affected:**
- `[path/to/file1]` -- [what changes here]

### Effort Estimate

| Scenario | Days | Assumption |
|----------|------|------------|
| Optimistic | [X] | Everything goes right, no surprises |
| Expected | [Y] | Normal pace, minor issues, one round of review |
| Pessimistic | [Z] | Significant unknowns surface, blocked for a day |

**Recommended budget: [Y days]**

### Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]

[Explain which factors drive the confidence level for this specific task.]

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Impact if Delayed |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|

### Suggested Breakdown

| # | Sub-task | Estimate | Notes |
|---|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | [Research / spike] | [X days] | |
| 2 | [Core implementation] | [X days] | |
| 3 | [Testing and validation] | [X days] | |
| | **Total** | **[Y days]** | |

### Notes and Assumptions
- [Key assumption that affects the estimate]
- [Any caveats about scope boundaries]
```

Output the estimate with a brief summary: recommended budget, confidence level, and the single biggest risk factor.

This skill is read-only — no files are written. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — estimate generated.

---

## Phase 5: Next Steps

- If confidence is Low: recommend a time-boxed spike (`$studio-prototype`) before committing.
- If the task is > 10 days: recommend breaking it into smaller stories via `$studio-create-stories`.
- To schedule the task: run `$studio-sprint-plan update` to add it to the next sprint (if the project has no sprint plan, as on the default minimal workflow, add it to the brief's build order instead).

### Guidelines

- Always give a range (optimistic / expected / pessimistic), never a single number
- The recommended budget should be the expected estimate, not the optimistic one
- Round to half-day increments — estimating in hours implies false precision for tasks longer than a day
- Do not pad estimates silently — call out risk explicitly so the team can decide
- Confidence is Low whenever the approach is undecided or the core requirements are still TBD — a range built on an unmade decision is a guess
