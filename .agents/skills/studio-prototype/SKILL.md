## Codex execution adapter

Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` before this workflow. Its Codex mappings and
the user's existing authorization govern this workflow and all referenced
upstream documents. Work from the repository root.

- `$studio-NAME` invokes a repository skill; arguments are the text supplied
  with the invocation. Do not expect Claude slash commands or `$ARGUMENTS`
  substitution. Read another skill's `SKILL.md` when chaining workflows.
- Run each **Execute before proceeding** shell block explicitly; Codex does
  not run Claude's inline shell preprocessing. Use the real configuration
  output. Report command failures rather than silently assuming defaults.
- `AskUserQuestion` means ask with an available Codex question tool or plain
  text, and wait when the answer is required. Previously authorized routine
  edits need no repeated per-file approval. Preserve unresolved game-design
  choices and the configured automation mode.
- Claude `Agent`/`Task`, `subagent_type`, and named roles mean Codex subagents.
  Use `.codex/agents/<role>.toml` when custom role selection is supported;
  otherwise pass its `developer_instructions` to the available spawn tool.
  Use only actual available tools, inherit the user's model, respect the
  concurrency limit, and collect results. If delegation is unavailable,
  perform the roles sequentially and label that limitation.
- `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash`/`WebSearch`/`WebFetch` are capability
  labels: map them to available file, patch, shell, and browsing tools.
  `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, and task lists map to available collaboration
  tools and a written task ledger; do not invent tools.
- Shared `.claude/docs`, `.claude/scripts`, `.claude/hooks`, and templates are
  intentional runtime dependencies. Relative `references/` and `scripts/`
  paths resolve against this skill's folder. Original references may still
  show `/NAME`: interpret known studio workflows as `$studio-NAME`.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a legacy engine/configuration mirror. Codex reads engine
  settings from `project.yaml` and explicitly reads the matching version
  reference. `@file` imports, Claude settings, status lines, and permissions
  do not configure Codex. Preserve `AGENTS.md` during engine setup.
- For design/architecture/registry/review inputs, apply
  `.claude/docs/bounded-document-reading.md`: inventory ranges and read with
  `.claude/scripts/read-markdown.py` using returned line/column cursors.
  Upstream "read in full" means complete coverage through bounded chunks,
  never an unbounded tool response. Record gaps as NOT ASSESSED.
- Edit upstream skill/role sources under `.claude/`, then run
  `python3 tools/codex/studio.py sync` to regenerate Codex copies. Do not edit
  generated files directly. Apply the same rule to framework self-tests.


**Execute before proceeding** (from the repository root):

```bash
bash ".claude/hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config --keys review_mode,automation,workflow
```
Resolved above — use as-is; `--review` overrides `review_mode` for this run. No
block → defaults in `.claude/docs/config-resolution.md`.

# Prototype

## Purpose

This is the **concept prototype** — a fast, throwaway build that answers one question:
*"Is this core idea actually fun to interact with?"*

**Default use** — run right after `$studio-brainstorm` and `$studio-setup-engine`, before writing
GDDs or architecture docs. Its verdict determines whether the concept is worth the
investment of full design documentation.

**Mid-production?** You can also run this at any stage to test a specific mechanic,
design change, or technical question. Pass `--spike` to activate spike mode: a
lightweight ~4-hour build with no GDD prerequisites and no phase gate implications.

**Already have GDDs and architecture complete?** To validate the full game loop
before committing to Production, run `$studio-vertical-slice` instead.

## Spike Mode

**Triggered by:** `--spike` flag OR "Mid-production spike" entry choice in Phase 1.

### Important Constraints

- Prototype code must NEVER import from production source files
- Production code must NEVER import from prototype directories
- If the recommendation is PROCEED, production implementation is written from
  scratch — prototype code is never refactored into production
- Total effort is hard-capped at 1 day (concept prototypes test one mechanic)
- Test ONE mechanic — if scope grows, stop and simplify the question
- No polish. No menus, no game over, no music, no UI unless it IS the mechanic
- If stuck after 2 hours of engine iteration, reframe the question or switch paths
- **3 PIVOT iterations → force a KILL decision.** If this is the third time the
  same concept has produced a PIVOT verdict, the concept likely doesn't work.
  Ask: "Is this the right idea, or am I in the sunk cost trap?" A new concept
  prototyped fresh will almost always beat a fourth iteration of a struggling one.
- Building 2-3 different concept variants and picking the best one is a healthier
  strategy than iterating one concept to death. Natural selection between prototypes
  beats willpower.
- **Networked/multiplayer games:** A local prototype cannot validate the feel of a
  networked mechanic. Latency fundamentally changes how combat, movement, and
  prediction feel — a prototype running at 0ms local will feel entirely different at
  80ms network delay. Use a local prototype to validate that the mechanic is
  *interesting*. Do not use it as evidence that it *feels good* under real network
  conditions. Network feel requires real peers or simulated latency (e.g., throttle
  tools, network condition simulators).
