## Codex execution adapter

Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` before this workflow. Its Codex mappings and
the user's existing authorization govern this workflow and all referenced
upstream documents. Work from the repository root.

- `$studio-NAME` invokes a repository skill; arguments are the text supplied
  with the invocation. Do not expect Claude slash commands or `$ARGUMENTS`
  substitution. Read another skill's `SKILL.md` when chaining workflows.
- Run each **Execute before proceeding** shell block explicitly; Codex does
  not run Claude's inline shell preprocessing. Use the real configuration
  output. Report command failures rather than silently assuming defaults.
- `AskUserQuestion` means ask with an available Codex question tool or plain
  text, and wait when the answer is required. Previously authorized routine
  edits need no repeated per-file approval. Preserve unresolved game-design
  choices and the configured automation mode.
- Claude `Agent`/`Task`, `subagent_type`, and named roles mean Codex subagents.
  Use `.codex/agents/<role>.toml` when custom role selection is supported;
  otherwise pass its `developer_instructions` to the available spawn tool.
  Use only actual available tools, inherit the user's model, respect the
  concurrency limit, and collect results. If delegation is unavailable,
  perform the roles sequentially and label that limitation.
- `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash`/`WebSearch`/`WebFetch` are capability
  labels: map them to available file, patch, shell, and browsing tools.
  `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, and task lists map to available collaboration
  tools and a written task ledger; do not invent tools.
- Shared `.claude/docs`, `.claude/scripts`, `.claude/hooks`, and templates are
  intentional runtime dependencies. Relative `references/` and `scripts/`
  paths resolve against this skill's folder. Original references may still
  show `/NAME`: interpret known studio workflows as `$studio-NAME`.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a legacy engine/configuration mirror. Codex reads engine
  settings from `project.yaml` and explicitly reads the matching version
  reference. `@file` imports, Claude settings, status lines, and permissions
  do not configure Codex. Preserve `AGENTS.md` during engine setup.
- For design/architecture/registry/review inputs, apply
  `.claude/docs/bounded-document-reading.md`: inventory ranges and read with
  `.claude/scripts/read-markdown.py` using returned line/column cursors.
  Upstream "read in full" means complete coverage through bounded chunks,
  never an unbounded tool response. Record gaps as NOT ASSESSED.
- Edit upstream skill/role sources under `.claude/`, then run
  `python3 tools/codex/studio.py sync` to regenerate Codex copies. Do not edit
  generated files directly. Apply the same rule to framework self-tests.


**Execute before proceeding** (from the repository root):

```bash
bash ".claude/hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config --keys automation,workflow,qa.level,system_overrides
```
Resolved above — use as-is. No block → defaults in
`.claude/docs/config-resolution.md`.


# Regression Suite

This skill ensures that every bug fix is backed by a test that would have
caught the original bug — and that the regression suite stays current as the
game evolves. It also detects when new features have been added without
corresponding regression coverage.

A regression suite is not a new test category — it is a **curated list of
tests already in `tests/`** that collectively cover the game's critical paths
and known failure points. This skill maintains that list.

**Output:** `tests/regression-suite.md`

**When to run:**
- After fixing a bug (confirm a regression test was written or identify gap)
- Before a phase gate — at `qa.level: full`, `$studio-gate-check` requires a regression suite
- As part of sprint close to detect coverage drift

---

Every `AskUserQuestion` call follows `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative asks always · guided major-only · autonomous logs and proceeds;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**Workflow tier**: `modes.workflow` as resolved above — supplied by `modes.rigor`
unless set explicitly — per `.claude/docs/workflow-modes.md`; in `audit` mode consider
`workflow_overrides.system_overrides.<system>` per system as each GDD is read. It
sets whether GDD critical paths are mapped or coverage is smoke-only — see Step 2c.

**`qa.level`**: controls whether the suite is generated at
all. At `minimal`, the regression suite is **not generated** (report that and
stop); at `standard`, generate it at Polish-stage entry; at `full`, at
Production-stage entry. Distinct axis from `workflow`.

## 1. Parse Arguments

**Early `qa.level` guard (resolved above):** if `qa.level: minimal`, the
regression suite is **not generated** — report "Regression suite not generated at
qa.level minimal" and **STOP here, before any scan**, in every mode
(`update` / `audit` / `report`). This is the `qa.level` axis; it is distinct from
the `workflow`-tier `minimal` branch in Step 2c (which only changes the
critical-path *source*, not *whether* the suite runs). Do not enter Step 2c's
`minimal` branch on account of `qa.level`. This stop's verdict is
**NOT ASSESSED** (Section 7) — tests are not required at this level, and nothing
was scanned.

**Modes:**
- `$studio-regression-suite update` — scan new bug fixes this sprint and check
  for regression test presence; add new tests to the suite manifest
- `$studio-regression-suite audit` — full audit of all GDD critical paths vs.
  existing test coverage; flag paths with no regression test
- `$studio-regression-suite report` — read-only status report (no writes); suitable
  for sprint reviews
- No argument — if a sprint is clearly active (sprint plan exists with in-progress stories), run `update`. If ambiguous or no active sprint is detected, use `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Prompt: "No subcommand specified. Which mode do you want to run?"
  - Options:
    - `[A] update — scan new bug fixes this sprint and add missing regression tests`
    - `[B] audit — full audit of all GDD critical paths vs. existing test coverage`
    - `[C] report — read-only status report (no writes)`

---

## 2. Load Context

### Step 2a — Load existing regression suite

Read `tests/regression-suite.md` if it exists. Extract:
- Total registered regression tests
- Last updated date
- Any tests flagged as `STALE` or `QUARANTINED`

If it does not exist: note "No regression suite found — will create one."

### Step 2b — Load test inventory

Glob all test files:
```
tests/unit/**/*_test.*
tests/integration/**/*_test.*
tests/regression/**/*
```

For each file, note the system (from directory path) and file name.
Do not read test file contents unless needed for name-to-test mapping.

### Step 2c — Load GDD critical paths

For `audit` mode: read `design/gdd/systems-index.md` to get all systems, then
scope the scan by each system's workflow tier (resolved above):
- **`full`** — read the GDD and map critical paths from all sections.
- **`standard`** — same, from the required sections (Acceptance Criteria, Edge
  Cases, and Formulas where the system defines numeric rules).
  A system pinned higher via `system_overrides` is mapped at its higher tier.
- **`minimal`** — **skip the GDD critical-path scan**. Instead read the latest
  smoke-check report in `production/qa/smoke-*.md` and take the critical paths it
  exercises as the regression scope (Step 3 maps coverage against those, not GDD
  acceptance criteria). If no smoke report exists, stop with Verdict: **NOT
  ASSESSED — no smoke report to take critical paths from** — there is no
  critical-path source at minimal without one; run `$studio-smoke-check` first.

(Tier affects `audit` mode only; `update` and `report` modes are tier-independent.)

For each in-scope MVP-tier system's GDD, extract:
- Acceptance Criteria (these define the critical paths)
- Formulas section (formulas must have regression tests)
- Edge Cases section (known edge cases should have regression tests)

For `update` mode: skip full GDD scan. Instead read the current sprint plan
and story files to find stories with Status: Complete this sprint.

### Step 2d — Load closed bugs

Glob `production/qa/bugs/*.md` and filter for bugs with a `Status: Closed`
or `Status: Fixed` field. Note:
- Which story or system the bug was in
- Whether a regression test was mentioned in the fix description

---

## 3. Map Coverage — Critical Paths

For `audit` mode only. (At `minimal` the critical paths come from the smoke-check
report identified in Step 2c, not from GDD acceptance criteria — map coverage
against those smoke paths and skip the GDD-criterion loop below.)

For each GDD acceptance criterion, determine whether a test exists:

1. Grep `tests/unit/[system]/` and `tests/integration/[system]/` for file names
   and function names related to the criterion's key noun/verb
2. Assign coverage:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **COVERED** | A test file exists that targets this criterion's logic |
| **PARTIAL** | A test exists but doesn't cover all cases (e.g. happy path only) |
| **MISSING** | No test found for this critical path |
| **EXEMPT** | Visual/Feel or UI criterion — not automatable by design |

3. Elevate MISSING items that correspond to formulas or state machines to
   **HIGH PRIORITY** gap — these are the most likely regression sources.

---

## 4. Map Coverage — Fixed Bugs

For each closed bug:

1. Extract the system slug from the bug's metadata
2. Grep `tests/unit/[system]/` and `tests/integration/[system]/` for a test
   that references the bug ID or the specific failure scenario
3. Assign:
   - **HAS REGRESSION TEST** — a test was found that would catch this bug
   - **MISSING REGRESSION TEST** — bug was fixed but no test guards against recurrence

For MISSING REGRESSION TEST items:
- Flag them as regression gaps
- Suggest the test file path: `tests/unit/[system]/[bug-slug]_regression_test.[ext]`
- Note: "Without this test, this bug can silently return in a future sprint."

---

## 5. Detect Coverage Drift

Coverage drift occurs when the game grows but the regression suite doesn't.

Check for drift indicators:
- Stories completed this sprint with no corresponding test files in `tests/`
- New systems added to `systems-index.md` since the last regression-suite update
- GDD sections added or revised since the regression suite was last updated
  (use Grep on GDD file modification hints if available, or ask the user)
- `tests/regression-suite.md` last-updated date vs. current date — if gap >
  2 sprints, flag as likely stale

---

## 6. Generate Report and Suite Manifest

### Report format (in conversation)

```
## Regression Suite Status

**Mode**: [update | audit | report]
**Existing registered tests**: [N]
**Test files scanned**: [N]

### Critical Path Coverage (audit mode only)
| System | Total ACs | Covered | Partial | Missing | Exempt |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| [name] | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] |

**Coverage rate (non-exempt)**: [N]%

### Bug Regression Coverage
| Bug ID | System | Severity | Has Regression Test? |
|--------|--------|----------|----------------------|
| BUG-NNNN | [system] | S[N] | YES / NO ⚠ |

**Bugs without regression tests**: [N]

### Coverage Drift Indicators
[List new systems or stories with no test coverage, or "None detected."]

### Recommended New Regression Tests
| Priority | System | Suggested Test File | Covers |
|----------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| HIGH | [system] | `tests/unit/[system]/[slug]_regression_test.[ext]` | BUG-NNNN / AC-[N] |
| MEDIUM | [system] | `tests/unit/[system]/[slug]_test.[ext]` | [criterion] |
```

### Suite manifest format (`tests/regression-suite.md`)

> **Before computing coverage, check the denominator.** If the GDD
> glob returns **zero critical paths**, or the test globs return **zero test
> files**, do not emit a percentage — report
> `Coverage: NOT ASSESSED — [no GDDs found | no test files found]` and name which
> side was empty and the skill that produces it (`$studio-map-systems` and
> `$studio-design-system` for GDDs, `$studio-test-setup` for the test scaffold).
>
> A percentage computed from an empty denominator is not a low score; it is not a
> number. `0%` reads as "measured and terrible" and `100%` as "measured and
> perfect" — both are claims about a comparison that never happened. This is the
> same defect `$studio-scope-check` carries a Phase 4 guard against, in the same words:
> *"a percentage computed from no baseline items is not a small number; it is not
> a number."*
>
> **A hand-written list of skills required to carry `NOT ASSESSED` pins what was
> known when it was written**, so a skill added later inherits no obligation and
> nothing notices. Derive that set rather than enumerating it.

The manifest is a curated index — not the tests themselves, but a registry
of which tests should always pass before a release:

```markdown
# Regression Suite Manifest

> Last Updated: [date]
> Total registered tests: [N]
> Coverage: [N]% of GDD critical paths

## How to run

[Engine-specific command to run all regression tests]

## Registered Regression Tests

### [System Name]

| Test File | Test Function (if known) | Covers | Added |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|-------|
| `tests/unit/[system]/[file]_test.[ext]` | `test_[scenario]` | AC-N / BUG-NNNN | [date] |

## Known Gaps

Tests that should exist but don't yet:

| Priority | System | Suggested Path | Covers | Reason Not Yet Written |
|----------|--------|----------------|--------|------------------------|
| HIGH | [system] | `tests/unit/[system]/[path]` | BUG-NNNN | Bug fixed without test |

## Quarantined Tests

Tests that are flaky or disabled (do not run in CI):

| Test File | Function | Reason | Quarantined Since |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| (none) | | | |
```

---

## 7. Write Output

In `update` or `audit` mode, ask: "May I write/update `tests/regression-suite.md` with the current
regression suite manifest?"

For `update` mode: append new entries; never remove existing entries
(use `Edit` with targeted insertions).
For `audit` mode: rewrite the full manifest with updated coverage data.
For `report` mode: do not write anything.

After writing (if approved):

- For each HIGH priority gap: "Consider creating the missing regression test
  before the next sprint. Run `$studio-test-helpers` to scaffold the test file."
- If bug regression gaps > 0: "These bugs can silently return without regression
  tests. The next sprint should include a story to write the missing tests."
- If coverage drift detected: "Regression suite may be drifting. Consider
  running `$studio-regression-suite audit` at the next sprint boundary."

At `workflow: minimal`, which has no sprints, say "next story" for "next sprint" in the three lines above.

Verdict, first match wins:
- **NOT ASSESSED** — the Section 1 stop at `qa.level: minimal`: "Regression
  suite not generated at qa.level minimal". Tests are not required at this
  level; nothing was scanned or written.
- **NOT ASSESSED** — the `minimal` stop above: no smoke report to take critical
  paths from; name `$studio-smoke-check` as the fix.
- **NOT ASSESSED** — coverage came back `Coverage: NOT ASSESSED — [reason]` (no GDDs or
  no test files); name the reason. Never report COMPLETE over a coverage figure
  that was not computed.
- **BLOCKED** — `update` or `audit` mode and the user declined the write.
- **COMPLETE** — `update` / `audit`: regression suite updated; `report`: coverage
  report shown (report mode writes nothing).

---

## Collaborative Protocol

**Applies in `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and
`autonomous` modes, see `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md` — the rules below
describe what collaborative mode requires, not universal behavior.

- **Never remove existing regression tests from the manifest** without
  explicit user approval — removing a test that was deliberately written is a
  regression risk itself
- **Gaps are advisory, not blocking** — surface them clearly but do not prevent
  other work from proceeding (except at `qa.level: full`, where phase gates require the regression suite)
- **Quarantine is not deletion** — tests with intermittent failures should be
  quarantined (noted in manifest) but not removed; they should be fixed by
  `$studio-test-flakiness`
- **Ask before writing** — always confirm before creating or updating the manifest
